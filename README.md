# CarFollowingModel
Develop Python code for Car-Following Modelthat include full velocity and vehicle terms proposed by Zhao and Gao (2005).Use the model to simulate the path of a SUV and a sedan following a 18Wheeler Truck on a single lane highway. The truck is initially traveling at 55mph and the SUV is traveling at 57 mph and the sedan at 54 mph. The SUVis 30 ft away from the Truck and the Sedan is 25 ft away from the SUV. Thetruck begins to accelerate for 5 min and reaches a speed of 60 mph and thenit breaks suddenly and decelerates down to 40 mph in the next 40 seconds.Create an User-Interface for the above problem for bonus points and Add anadditional car that is 10 ft behind the sedan and moving at 55 mph at thestart of the simulation for additional bonus points.
